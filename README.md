## Final task for my CSH2G3 class

### What is quick sort ??

Quicksort is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm. It works by selecting a **'pivot'** element from the array and **partitioning** the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
